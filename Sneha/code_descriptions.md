# Python Codes

- `red_drone.py` : drone flies to a point and executes RTL if it detects red through camera during its flight, else it executes RTL after reaching the point
- `follow_red_xy.py` : drone takes off to 10m and tries to centre at the largest red object detected in the frame using yaw movements and changing altitude
